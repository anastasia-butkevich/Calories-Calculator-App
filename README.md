## Simple Calories Calculator
The calculator has a Tkinter GUI and accepts the user's physical data and calculates BMI (body mass index), daily calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates based on these parameters: gender, weight, height, and activity level. It also allows you to choose a target weight, which affects the daily nutrient intake. 

It has a calorie table that can be used to calculate the nutritional value of a certain weight of food. The calculator shows the percentage of calorie and nutrient deficit/surplus.
It saves the table in a json file.
